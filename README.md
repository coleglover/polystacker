# polystacker

Thanks for checking out the polystacker. 

The purpose of this add on is to take a subset of selected polygons (in my case - footprints of photographs) and snap them to a single point. This helps 
organize your images and may reduce error further down the production line if you plan on doing further analysis of your image groups. 

Enjoy!

Instructions for adding into your QGIS plugins folder:

Your plugin PolyStacker was created in:
    C:/Users/[user]/AppData/Roaming/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/python/plugins\poly_stacker

Your QGIS plugin directory is located at:
    C:/Users/[user]/AppData/Roaming/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/python/plugins

What's Next:

  * Copy the entire directory containing your new plugin to the QGIS plugin
    directory

  * Compile the resources file using pyrcc5

  * Run the tests (``make test``)

  * Test the plugin by enabling it in the QGIS plugin manager

  * Customize it by editing the implementation file: ``poly_stacker.py``

  * Create your own custom icon, replacing the default icon.png

  * Modify your user interface by opening PolyStacker_dialog_base.ui in Qt Designer

  * You can use the Makefile to compile your Ui and resource files when
    you make changes. This requires GNU make (gmake)
